# Automatic Attendance System
Traditionally attendance is marked manually by teachers and they must make sure that 
correct attendance is marked for respective student. This whole process wastes some of the 
lecture time and part of the correct information is missed due to fraudulent and proxy cases. 
In order to determine classroom attendance, face detection and face recognition are 
performed. Face detection is used to determine the location of the faces in the classroom 
image and extract sub images for each face. Then, in face recognition, the face images 
detected will be compared with the data base consisting of images of students in the class, 
and attendance will be recorded accordingly.
